## Level 2

#### It was a bit more challenging but ultimately the code worked. Making sure the listener was 'listening' for the correct input took a bit of figuring out.
### Steps:
#### 1. Create variable for data
#### 2. Reference the table body
#### 3. Reference the input element (repeated for date, city, state, country, shape)
#### 4. Create function for when the input field is clicked.
#### 5. Create function for when the input field is changed by adding input text
#### 6. Set new input text as filter variable
#### 7. Loop through the dataset to retrieve the matching entries and append them to the html table.


## Customization
#### Very minor customization done.
